    "text": "Breakdown of the Code\nTo generate the interactive plot, we will be using the following code to generate the plot. fig = px.scatter(data_frame = dataset, x = “column name 1”, y = “column name 2”, title = “title of plot”, color = “column name 3”, hover_data = [“other columns to display”], width = num, height = num, opacity = num )\nThe arguments used is:  - data_frame = dataset we are using for this plot - x = a specific column from the data set that will be used on the x-axis - y = a sepcific column from the data set tht will be used on the y-axis - title = main title of the plot - color = the color of the points (can be used to seperate different categories i.e. species of penguins) - hover_data = other column information that you would like to display when user hovers over a specific point (note: the columns used for x, y, and color will already be shown when the user hovers over a specific point) - width = the width of the plot - height = the height of the plot - opacity = allows the point on the plot to be sheer\nWe will now be replacing our data set with the respective column names into the code.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins,\n                 x = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n                 y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\",\n                 title = \"Body Mass and Flipper Length in Penguin Species\",\n                 color = \"Species\",\n                 hover_data = [\"Individual ID\"],\n                 width = 500,\n                 height = 300,\n                 opacity = 0.5\n                )\n\nfig.update_layout(margin={\"r\":0, \"t\":30, \"l\":0, \"b\":0})\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nIf we hover our cursor over the points in the plot, we can see information about the specific point. For this particular example, it is able to show you the type of species, the body mass/flipper length for this particular penguin, and the penguin’s ID number."

    "text": "Analysis of Plot\nFrom the outputted plot, we can see that Gentoo Penguins have a bigger body mass and longer flippers compared to Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. In addition, we can see the Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have similar body mass and Flipper length. Therefore, there does seem to be a correlation between flipper length and body mass of the penguins. For penguins with bigger body mass, they seem to have longer flippers, while smaller body mass penguins have shorter flippers. It is possible that the bigger penguins will need to have bigger flippers for balance and support!"

Let me show you the difference of using it and not using it.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins,\n                 x = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n                 y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\",\n                 title = \"Body Mass and Flipper Length in Penguin Species\",\n                 color = \"Species\",\n                 hover_data = [\"Individual ID\"],\n                 width = 500,\n                 height = 300,\n                 opacity = 0.5\n                )\n\n# fig.update_layout(margin={\"r\":0, \"t\":0, \"l\":0, \"b\":0})\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nAbove is what it looks like when we commented out the line of code. The plot looks squashed and not as clear compared to when we adjusted the layout of the plot. There are still a lot of other arguments that you can add to the plot to customize it.
